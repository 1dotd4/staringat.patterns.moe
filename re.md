# About machines and languages

Computers compute what a programmer programmed.

Sometimes programmers make mistake or computers glitch.

Better know both.

## Scripting

Learn to use your computer, learn to write scripts, automate stuff.

You don't want to do manually what a computer can do by itself.

## Languages

Tips:

- experiment yourself
- try reproducing simple applications
- learn the main paradigms not many languages
- python3/sagemath is fine

## Assembly and reversing

Learn to read assembly code, learn how it's generated.

Recognize structure, there are many.

Recognize patterns, there are few.
