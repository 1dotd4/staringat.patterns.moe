% <a href="/">Staring at patterns</a>

# What is this?

This is an experiment to bring order and clarity among some patterns in cryptography.

# What are patterns?

We find a good definition of pattern the following:

> A pattern is a recurrent movement in structures, where a structure is a configuration or an arrangement of elements that — structure — we can recognize and manipulate with a pattern.

# Why stare at them?

Did you know that staring enough on an image you will find patters?

This apply to problems too — if correctly represented — and it's very useful in cryptography too.

You may later tell that you guessed it, but that's what happened in reality.

# How do I contribute?

Get in touch with the community somewhere. We preferred not to tie it to some distinct platform or protocol, in the end there will be some maintainers that will add contributions. You can clone the repository and suggest a patch. We will post our graph for contributing, until then you can [checkout the gitbook examples on decentalized workflows](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows).

Usually a new topic can be added by explaining the following points:

- introduction: outline of the topic;
- properties: rules, conditions, attacks, edge cases and so on;
- references: papers, books, links, writeups, examples and so on.
